# The catch method

The `catch` method on a promise is pretty simple because it is an alias for `then(null, errorCallback)`.

```javascript
var promise = request();

promise.catch(function(error) {
  displayError(error);
});

// This is the same code as this:
promise.then(null, function(error) {
  displayError(error);
});
```

Why is `catch` so important? Because combined with the chaining feature of promises, it becomes very strong. Before we continue though, you have to learn the differences between these 2 examples:

```javascript
// Example 1
let promise = request();

promise.then(function(data) {
  console.log(data);
}, function(error) {
  console.error(error);
});


// Example 2
let promise = request();

promise

.then(function(data) {
  console.log(data);
})

.catch(function(error) {
  console.error(data);
});
```

In the first example, we call `then` with a success callback and an error callback. In the second example, we call `then` with a success callback and after that we call `catch` with an error callback. The difference is in the promise returned by the `then` function. In the second example, you are not calling `catch` on the original promise, you call `catch` on the promise returned by `then`. If a `then` has no error callback provided, it will not stop on a rejected promise. So the promise will end in the `catch`.

For a better understanding, take a look at this control flow diagram (left diagram is for example 1, right diagram is for example 2).

To understand how to use `then` and `catch` directly, you can think of it as pretty similar to using `try { ... } catch { ... }`. Let's take the 2 examples and express them in "pseudo-synchronous code"

```javascript
// Example 1
try {
  let promise = request();
} catch (error) {
  console.error(error);
  return;
}
console.log(data);

// Example 2
try {
  let promise = request();
  console.log(data);
} catch (error) {
  console.error(error);
}
```

The difference is easy to understand when you express the code in "pseudo-synchronous code". You can use the promise's `catch` like a normal `catch` and everything is simple to understand. Keep in mind that a `then` callback can crash. It can throw an error (with an explicit throw or by trying to reach a property of a `null` variable). The `catch` method will also catch these crashes. Repeat to yourself: the promise's `catch` method is like a normal `catch`.
